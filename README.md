## Business Problem

The Polish consulting firm hired me to analyze the financial standing of the Polish companies to predict whether they will go to bankruptcy in 1-5 years or not. The results of the study will be used to the advise firm customers on their investments. Therefore, the focus of the analysis will be identifying the companies which will not go to bankruptcy in near future.
